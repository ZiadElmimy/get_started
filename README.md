# This is the first Repository on my GitHub
  I am learnig to deal with git and github to be more effecient and more relevvent to work with teams 
  and cooperate with others.

## Push or Pull the files to GitHub using Git commands
   - you need to have the RemoteName and BranchName to be able to push you files to remote repo 
      - to have the branch name --> git branch
      - to get the remote name --> git remote -v
      --> and after that you can push your files by --> git push RemoteName BranchName

   - And to pull a copy fron the remote repository you need to know the RemoteName
      --> and after getting the remote name as said previously you pull the copy by --> git pull RemoteName
